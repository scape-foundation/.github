The Scape Foundation believes that our cities are the forests of the future. A newfound nature in which ecological, social and economic values are in perfect harmony. The mission of the Scape Foundation is to create regenerative urban landscapes by fusing nature, people and technology into positive future-proof solutions. We set forth to develop co-creation platforms and open-source instruments that bridge the gap between research, design and development.
